# Mechatronics Course Platform (G7-G12)

Welcome to the Mechatronics Course Platform! This is an interactive educational web application designed to teach the fundamentals of mechatronics, inspired by MIT's curriculum and scaled for students from Grade 7 to Grade 12.

## Purpose of the Project

This project was created to provide a free, accessible, and engaging learning experience for students interested in mechatronics. It breaks down complex topics into simple, manageable units with video lectures and quizzes to test understanding. The entire platform is designed to be multilingual and saves student progress directly in their browser.

## Powered by the Google Ecosystem

A key goal of this project is to demonstrate the power and accessibility of Google's development ecosystem for building and deploying real-world applications **for free**.

This entire application is built and hosted using the following Google Cloud and Firebase services:

*   **Firebase Hosting:** The web application is deployed on Firebase Hosting, a fast, secure, and reliable service that provides a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) at no cost. This means the website loads quickly for users anywhere in the world.
*   **Google Gemini in Firebase Studio:** All the code for this project was developed with the assistance of Google's Gemini AI, integrated directly into the Firebase Studio IDE. This showcases how modern AI can accelerate development, from generating code to debugging and deployment.

This project is a perfect example of how anyone—students, educators, or hobbyists—can take an idea and turn it into a globally available web application without needing a powerful computer for hosting or a credit card for deployment.

## Learn and Build Your Own!

This project is open-source and created for educational purposes. You are encouraged to explore the code, learn from it, and even create your own applications based on this model.

**How to get started:**

1.  **Explore the Code:** The primary file is `src/index.html`. It contains all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to run the application. You can see how the curriculum is structured, how quizzes work, and how progress is saved using the browser's `localStorage`.
2.  **Use the Live Link:** Share the live demo link with anyone who wants to learn about mechatronics: [https://mit-pre-education-482838-c0baf.web.app](https://mit-pre-education-482838-c0baf.web.app)
3.  **Build Your Own Project:** You can use a free tool like **Firebase Studio** to start a new project from a template. With the help of AI and free hosting, you can bring your own ideas to life.

The world of technology is open to everyone, and with free tools like those offered by Google, you have everything you need to start building. Good luck!
